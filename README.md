# JWT-App
A Python application that used the open standard JWT to encrypt communication between a pc and a server.

# Objectives
1. Create a pretty UX
2. think about how to implement JWT to make a safe login
3. Create a database (maybe with postgresql?)
4. think about how to insert data from Linkedin CSV to the database created.

To make this project respectful being respected, I should talk with someone that knows what am I doing and do the changes

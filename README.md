# Job application helper

A Python application that can be used to trace own job applications history and check the job applications acitivity state. I think that to find a job, together with the idea to improve your visibility and give value to their work experiences, could be useful have a tool that help people to check job applications history and data analysis about which job applications are active, signed by the user or the system, in a month or more.
